			<h1 class="header">Richardson's 22, Wade's 19, lead Heat past <br/> Pelicans 102-96</h1>
			<h3>By Brett Martel, Associated Press</h3>
			<p>NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Josh Richardson scored 22 points, Dwyane Wade added 19 in what was likely his final game in New Orleans, and the Miami Heat beat the Pelicans 102-96 on Sunday night (Monday, PHL time).
			Hassan Whiteside had 17 points and 12 rebounds in his matchup with Anthony Davis.
			<br/><br/>
			Davis had 27 points, 12 rebounds, three blocks and three steals, but curiously did not take his first shot of the second half until hitting a three-pointer with 5:43 left in the fourth quarter.
			<br/><br/>
			Davis' second triple of the period had the Pelicans as close as 96-90 with 2:32 to go. But Miami, which led nearly the entire game — and by as much as 17 — squashed any hope of a late comeback with clutch play from Wade, whose driving floater in the lane made it 100-92 with 51 seconds left.
			<br/><br/>
			Wade, who received an enthusiastic ovation when he first checked in, also drew cheers as he left the court from fans gathering near the tunnel to the visitor's locker room. They chanted "D-Wade! D-Wade!" as he stopped to signs autographs.</p>

			<h1 class="header">Nuggets beat Raptors 95-86 in matchup of conference leaders.</h1>
			<h3>By Pat Graham, Associated Press</h3>
			<p>DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic scored 26 points, Jamal Murray had 15 of his 19 in the fourth quarter and the banged-up Denver Nuggets rallied past the equally banged-up Toronto Raptors 95-86 on Sunday night (Monday, PHL time) in a contest between conference leaders.
			<br/><br/>
			Trailing 70-57 in the third quarter, the Nuggets went on a 23-2 run to send them to their 10th win in 12 games and retain a slim lead over Golden State in the Western Conference. This marks the latest the Nuggets (20-9) have been in first place in the West since Dec. 18, 1984, according to information by Elias Sports Bureau.
			<br/><br/>
			Kawhi Leonard had 29 points and 14 rebounds for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who finished 2-2 on their trip. They still own the league's best mark at 23-9.
